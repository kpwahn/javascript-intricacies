# Object Literals

This is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Object.

Using an object literal, you both define and create an object in one statement.

An object literal is a list of name:value pairs (like age: 30) inside curly braces {}.

The following example creates a new JavaScript object with two properties:

```javascript
let person = {
    age: 30,
    name: "John"
}
```
