# Primitives

A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.

A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.

JavaScript defines 5 types of primitive data types:
* string
* number
* boolean
* null
* undefined

**Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and therefore cannot be changed).**

>if x = 3.14, you can change the value of x. But you cannot change the value of 3.14.

## In JavaScript anything that is not a primitive type (undefined, null, number, string, boolean) is an object (or an instance) in JavaScript. <sup>[1](#functionIsObject)</sup>
